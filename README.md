## Theme: Shapeshift

## Language: http://dartlang.org

## Game Premise
  Constantly running forward you need to shape-shift yourself into a balloon and keep yourself from falling through the ground (as a ball/whatever) and hitting the roof (as a balloon/whatever)

## Controls
  1) SHIFT - Hold to phase into your alt state
  2) SPACE - JUMP/ADD WEIGHT

## Other Possible Ideas
  1
    basic premise
      You have to run around and full-fill your werewolf/spider hunger by eating people, but being in alternate form makes people scared of you so you need to get close and not get caught
    perspective
      2D
      platformer style
    player modes
      human form
        hiding from people searching for the killer
      alternate form
        run around killing people

    basic premise

    player modes
      main form
        2d platformer style, can only move left and right
      alt form
        hmm....

  3 -  PROBABLY GOING TO DO THIS ONE
    basic premise
      normal/shadow modes, solve platformer puzzles and stuffs. Lightbeams from rooms, use those beams to better position yourself
    downfall
      going to be quite a bit of work to get it all implemented = no sleep for ryan this weekend, and might not even finish it

    premise
      hit a button to switch between dimensions, both dimensions are references by color scheme of them, and you have to match the dimension otherwise you will fall through the floor. Think Temple Run, but instead of choosing paths, you select your dimensions
    perspective
      2d puzzle platformer, locked forward input
      over the shoulder, locked forward input

  5
    premise
      switch being being a rolling ball and a balloon, as a ball bounce on the ground to progress forward, jumping and all that... Then the floor will disappear and you have to switch to a balloon and not hit the ceiling using your "jump" to push you down

      guy holding balloon, can shapeshift into something light
    perspective
      2d platformer, locked forward motion, you control y
